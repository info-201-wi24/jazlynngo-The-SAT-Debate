# Introduction
The SAT is a standardized exam to measure the knowledge of students in various subjects such as math, reading, and writing. It is used by many universities to make admission decisions. Since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, many universities have made the decision to remove this testing requirement from their admission requirements due to government mandated social distancing. This decision raised the question of how crucial this exam really is in college admission and why underlying demographics may show that this requirement is not all about student knowledge. Now, we aim to explore the impact of social demographics on average SAT scores. Through investigating several datasets that focus on household income, English language use at home, and average student GPA in relation to average SAT scores, we will aim to answer the following questions:

     Are there trends between median household income and average SAT score?
     Do states with more English language speakers have higher average SAT scores?
     How does gender and SAT score vary by state?
Data usage:
Our first data source is a dataset consisting of SAT scores from across the country. The dataset holds testing numbers across all categories of the SAT test as well as average student GPA through various subjects. The data was generate from the college board students who took the exam and also participated in the survey. It also holds data on average household income and gender of the participating students.

     Our second dataset was generated from the Annie Casey foundation, a group that aims to improve student health outcomes. The numbers of children who speak a language other than English home comes from government data and contains numbers across different states from 2000-2003

Limitations and ethical questions to consider:
     As with most datasets, there are inevitable aspects that present us with limitations and ethical questions. Some limitations presented in our own dataset are
     that numbers may be skewed as not every student that took the SAT exam took the corresponding writing exam. With that said, not every student that took the SAT exam 
     chose to participate in the data survey, so the numbers in the dataset are limited to the number of students who chose to participate, not all who attended. Ethical questions
     we can consider are if SAT data collection should also open up gender options to other than female and male and if there are demographics underlying income and English use that may
     be impacting SAT scores. English language use and household income may be connected by another demographic such as immigrant populations or populations of color, which may
     be impacting SAT numbers.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
Upon concluding our research, it is evident that the SAT is not simply a test of academic proficiency, but also a reflection of external factors in studentsâ€™ lives. Our exploration of data specifically on household income, gender, and students who speak a language other than English at home reveals correlation to average SAT scores that imply a broader context underlying test outcomes.

Takeaway #1
Firstly, our analysis of household income reveals an association between lower household income and diminished SAT performance. This correlation highlights the impact of economic circumstances on a student's test-taking abilities as well as the role of financial resources in academic achievement.
Takeaway #2
Next, our investigations explore the number of students who speak a language other than English at home. It exposed a notable trend whereas individuals speaking other languages at home tend to score less favorably on the SAT, particularly in the verbal section. This observation suggests a language barrier, underscoring the challenges faced by non-native English speakers when navigating an English test.
Takeaway #3
Lastly, our examination of gender disparities in SAT scores reveals male students outperforming female students across various states despite a higher participation rate among females. This underscores potential differences in test-taking strategies or societal expectations and prompts further research into the factors shaping gender-based academic outcomes.

Summary
In essence, our findings shed light on the interplay between demographic variables and SAT performance, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the diverse influences at play. By acknowledging these underlying factors, educators and policymakers can strive towards more equitable assessment practices and working towards inclusive learning environments to strive for academic success for all students.
