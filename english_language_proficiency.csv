"a Respondents were asked if the children in the household spoke a language other than English at home and how well they could speak English. Categories used for reporting were “Very well,” “Well,” “Not well,” and “Not at all.” All those reported to speak English less than “Very well” were considered to have difficulty speaking English based on an evaluation of the English-speaking ability of a sample of the children in the 1980s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Numbers from the Current Population Survey (CPS) in 1995 and after may reflect changes in the survey because of newly instituted computer-assisted interviewing techniques and/or because of the change in the population controls to the 1990 Census-based estimates, with adjustments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c In the 1979 CPS questionnaire, the language spoken at home variable had 10 specific categories: Chinese, Filipino, French, German, Greek, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Other. In the 1989 CPS questionnaire, the language spoken at home variable had 34 specific categories. In the 1992–1999 CPS questionnaires, the language spoken at home variable had four categories: Spanish, Asian, Other European, and Other. In the American Community Survey (ACS), respondents are asked the question, and their response is recorded in an open-ended format.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d From 1979 to 1999, following the 1977 U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for collecting and presenting data on race, the CPS asked respondents to choose one race from the following: White, Black, American Indian or Alaskan Native, or Asian or Pacific Islander. The U.S. Census Bureau also offered an “Other” category. Beginning in 2000, following the 1997 OMB standards for collecting and presenting data on race, the ACS asked respondents to choose one or more races from the following: White, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. In addition, a “Some other race” category was included with OMB approval. Those who chose more than one race were classified as “Two or more races.” Except for those who were “Two or more races,” all race groups discussed in this table from 2000 onward refer to people who indicated only one racial identity within the racial categories presented. People who responded to the question on race by indicating only one race are referred to as the race-alone population. The use of the race-alone population in this table does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing data. Prior to 2000, “Asian” refers to Asians and Pacific Islanders; beginning in 2000, “Asian” refers to Asians alone. Data from 2000 onward are not directly comparable with data from earlier years. Data on race and Hispanic origin are collected separately. Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
